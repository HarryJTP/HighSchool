# HighSchool
This area is to showcase projects I did for Computer Science at GCSE.
It will only include the two major projects which I worked on at this point, being the OAT's Top Trumps game and the Dice Game project.
The OAT's Top Trumps game is the first one I did which is completed.
The Dice Game project is the second one I started working on, but I never got around to completing it as around this time we began revising for our GCSE's.
I will upload two versions of the Dice Game Project: My original version which was not completed during GCSE, and the finished project which I will have completed after GCSE.
