This was a project created for an Ormiston Academies Trust coding competition, early into Year 11. For some reason the competition didn't continue. I'm not sure if this was due to my school or Ormiston Academies Trust.

This is a Top Trump Game. When it says Enter to continue, and there is a menu screen, you can input w or s to scroll through the options, and then input nothing to select the option.
There are multiple decks you can choose, with different categories, cards and attributes.
You both pick a card. The category is then randomly decided, as otherwise it would be unfair. Whoever has the highest attribute for that category is the winner.
You cannot both pick the same card.

This project was made with python.
